\caption{\label{fig:experimental-pos-dist} Distribution of distances between predicted
positions of origin and the highest intensity pixel(HIP) in the corresponding images. 
The model was a custom cnn architecture, trained on simulated data where (b) denotes 
that elect pixels were set to zero across the dataset. This model was selected for this
plot due to it having the lowest mean distance from HIP.}
