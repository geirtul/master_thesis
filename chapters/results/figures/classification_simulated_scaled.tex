\caption{\label{fig:simulated-scaled-intensities}Fraction of simulated single events correctly classified
as a function of scaling factor used to increase the total intensity in simulated decays. In the title of
each plot is the dataset the models were trained on. The dataset used for prediction is dataset $a$.}
