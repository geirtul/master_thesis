\section{Classification}
Our primary objective is to separate experimental data into two possible categories.
Supervised learning typically leverages large amounts of labeled data to learn
representations of the classes present in the inputs. A challenge in Physics is that
experiments generate enormous amounts of data, but it is not labeled. Hand-labeling
data is time-consuming and cost-ineffective. A possible solution to this challenge
is to train models on simulated data. The idea being that simulated and experimental
data are similar enough that the learned patterns from simulated data are, to some degree,
transferrable to experimental data.
The simulated data contains two classes of events - a single electron and a double electron.

\subsection{Simulated data}
In table \ref{tab:classification-simulated-f1-auc} the performance of each model 
trained is reported using the f1-score. The model architecture for each model is described in (ref appendix).
As a benchmark, we are including a state of the art pretrained network (\cite{}VGG HERE) applied to the data 
using the approach described in \ref{section:method-pretrained}.
\input{chapters/results/figures/classification_simulated_f1_auc.tex}
In figure \ref{tab:classification-simulated-pixelmod-f1-auc} we show the performance
of the same architectures trained on data where specific pixels are set to 0 to mimic
the experimental dataset.

\section{Regression}
On data already classified, we attempt to predict the energy of the events and the position of origin for
the electrons. Because there is a travel distance between the ejection site and the scintillator array,
the positions aren't necessarily the locations of the highest-intensity pixels in the detector images.
