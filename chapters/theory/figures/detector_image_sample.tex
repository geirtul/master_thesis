    \caption{\label{fig:exp-background-sample-images} Sample images from 
    simulated and experimental datasets. The top row contains simulated samples
    and the bottom row contains experimental samples. The labeling as "easy" and "hard"
    double events is based on experience from hand-labeling, and theoretical
    expectations.}
