\caption{\label{fig:experimental-pos-dist} Distribution of distances between predicted
positions of origin and the highest intensity pixel(HIP) in the corresponding images. 
The model was a custom cnn architecture, trained on dataset $c$. The simulated single
decay distribution is generated with the true potitions of the events, not
predicted ones.}
