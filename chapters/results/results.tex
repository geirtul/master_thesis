\section{Classification}
For the goal of classifying simulated data, we have used five different model types,
spanning a range of complexities, architectures, and parameters.
The reason for multiple models is the fundamental difference between the
simulated and experimental datasets; labels. Without ground truth labels
for the experimental data, we need other ways to assess how a model performs in
its task. We attempt to gain some insight by comparing the models' performance on
simulated data with their outputs when applied to experimental data.

We train the models on three sets of simulated data.
The first (a) is the simulated data as-is, with no changes apart from normalization
and pre-processing. The second (b) is the same dataset, but with specific pixels in
the 'detector images' set to zero. These pixels are effectively "dead" in the
experimental dataset, and mimicking this in the simulated data may allow us to monitor
what effect this has on model performance.

\subsection{Simulated data}
In table \ref{tab:classification-simulated-all-f1-auc} the performance of each model 
trained is reported using the f1-score and auc-score. The model architecture for each 
model is described in (ref appendix).
As a benchmark, we are including a state of the art pretrained 
network (\cite{}VGG HERE) applied to the data using the approach described 
in \ref{section:method-pretrained}.

\section{Regression}
On data already classified, we attempt to predict the energy of the events and the position of origin for
the electrons. Because there is a travel distance between the ejection site and the scintillator array,
the positions aren't necessarily the locations of the highest-intensity pixels in the detector images.
